x86 32bit operating system of the future (past)

This is a simple operating system I've made as a CS project. It'd been made for learning purposes, and uses practices and systems I've made myself to have it as simple and effective as possible.
The kernel is monolithic.

I'll add to this readme whenever I can bother, maybe even make a wiki. DM me if you found this page and want help, I've spent months on learning and fixing issues, soooo.... might be of service.
